Make way for Prince Ali
Say hey, it's Prince Ali
Hey! Clear the way in the old bazaar
Hey you! Let us through!
It's a brand new star!
Oh come, be the first on your block to meet his eye!
Make way! Here he comes!
Ring bells! Bang the drums!
You're gonna love this guy
Prince Ali! Fabulous he!
Ali Ababwa
Show some respect, boy, genuflect, down on one knee
Ohhh
Now, try your best to stay calm
Brush up your Friday salaam
Then come and meet his spectacular coterie
Prince AlM, mighty is he
Ali Ababwa
Strong as ten regular men, definitely
He's faced the galloping hordes
A hundred bad guys with swords
Who sent those goons to their lords?
Why, Prince Ali
Fellas, he's got
He's got seventy-five golden camels
Woo, uh-huh, now the ladies, what he got?
Purple peacocks, he's got fifty-three
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
When it comes to exotic-type mammals, everybody help me out
He's got a zoo
I'm telling you
I's a world-class menagerie
Prince Ali, handsome is he
There's no question this Ali's alluring
Ali Ababwa
Never ordinary, never boring
That physique!
Everything about that man
How can I speak, weak at my knees
Just plain impresses
You yummy boy
So, get on out in that square
He's a winner, he's a whiz, a wonder
Adjust your veil and prepare
He's about to pull my heart asunder
To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali, oops
And I absolutely love the way he dresses
He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys
He got the monkeys, a bunch of monkeys
And to view them he charges no fee
He's generous, so generous
He's got 10,000 servants and flunkies
Proud to work for him
They bow to his whim, love serving him
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali
Prince Ali
Prince Aaa-
We waitin' for you
We're not going 'til you go
You can do it
There it is
Prince Ali
Amorous he! Ali Ababwa
Heard your princess was hot, where is she?
And that, good people, is why he got all cute and dropped by
With sixty elephants, llamas galore (For real!?)
With his bears and lions a brass band and more (What?)
With his forty fakirs (Oh!) his cooks, his bakers (Oh!)
His birds that warble on key (Oh!)
Make way for Prince Ali!
Oh, imagine a land, it's a faraway place
Where the caravan camels roam
Where you wander among every culture and tongue
It's chaotic, but hey, it's home
When the wind's from the east
And the sun's from the west
And the sand in the glass is right
Come on down, stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly
To another Arabian night
As you wind through the streets at the fabled bazaars
With the cardamom-cluttered stalls
You can smell every spice
While you haggle the price
Of the silks and the satin shawls
Oh, the music that plays
As you move through a maze
In the haze of your pure delight
You are caught in a dance
You are lost in the trance
Of another Arabian night
Arabian nights
Like Arabian days
More often than not are hotter than hot
In a lot of good ways
Arabian nights
Like Arabian dreams
This mystical land of magic and sand
Is more than it seems
There's a road that may lead you
To good or to greed through
The power your wishing commands
Let the darkness unfold or find fortunes untold
Well, your destiny lies in your hands
Only one may enter here
One whose worth lies far within
A diamond in the rough
Arabian nights
Like Arabian days
They seem to excite, take off and take flight
To shock and amaze
Arabian nights
'Neath Arabian moons
A fool off his guard could fall and fall hard
Out there on the dunes
Here I go!
Unh, ooh, woo!
Back up! Uh-oh! Watch out! Unh!
You done wound me up!
'Boutta show you what I'm workin' with, unh!
Well, Ali Baba, he had them forty thieves
Scheherazade had a thousand tales
But, master, you're in luck because up your sleeves
You got a brand of magic never fails
You got some power in your corner now
Heavy ammunition in your camp
You got some punch, pizazz, yahoo, and how?
All you gotta do is rub that lamp
And then I'll say
Mister– Man, what's your name? Whatever–
What will your pleasure be?
Let me take your order, I'll jot it down
You ain't never had a friend like me
Life is your restaurant
And I'm your maitre d'
Come, whisper to me whatever it is you want
You ain't never had a friend like me
We pride ourselves on service
You the boss, the king, the shah!
Say what you wish, it's yours! True dish
How about a little more baklava?
Have some of column A
Try all of column B
I'm in the mood to help you, dude
You ain't never had a friend like me
Oh! Unh!
It's the big part, watch out!
It's the big part, oh!
Can your friends do this?
Can your friends do that?
Can your friends pull this
Outta they little hat?
Can your friends go–
I'm the genie of the lamp
I can sing, rap, dance, if you give me a chance, oh!
Don't sit there buggy-eyed
I'm here to answer all your midday prayers
You got me bona fide, certified
You got a genie for your charge d'affaires
I got a powerful urge to help you out
So what's your wish? I really wanna know
You got a list that's three miles long, no doubt
Well, all you gotta do is rub like so
Mister–
Aladdin
Yes!
One wish or two or three
Well, I'm on the job, you big nabob

Give it to your friend let's spin, everybody lookin' at me
Glancin' the kid, wishing they was dancin' a jig

In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub, uh
No love for the haters, the haters
Mad cause I got floor seats at the Lakers
See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders
Met Ali he told me I'm the greatest
I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd-pleaser
DJ play another from the prince of this
Your highness, only mad chicks ride in my whips
South to the West to the East to the North
Bought my hits and watch them go off a go off

Eight-fifty I.S. if you need a lift
Who's the kid in the drop? Who else Will Smith
Living that life some consider a myth
Rock from South Street to one-two-fifth
Women used to tease me, give it to me now nice and easy
Since I moved up like George and Weezie
C.R.E.A.M. to the maximum I be asking 'em
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum?
Never see Will attacking 'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and 'em, flatten 'em
Psych, kidding
Thought I took a spill, but I didn't
Trust the lady of my life she hitting
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon
Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly
You trying to flex on me?

Miami the bass and the sunset low
Everyday like a mardi gras, everybody party all day
No work all play, okay
So we sip a little something, leave the rest to spill
Me n' Charlie at the bar runnin up a high bill
Nothin less than ill, when we dress to kill
Everytime the ladies pass, they be like (Hi Will)
Can y'all feel me, all ages and races
Real sweet faces
Every different nation, Spanish, Hatian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban, and Asian
I only came for two days of playing
But everytime I come I always wind up stayin
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami
Welcome to Miami
Yo I heard the rainstorms ain't nothin to mess with
But I can't feel a drip on the strip, it's a trip
Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
And they be screamin out, (Will we loved your last hit)
So I'm thinkin I'mma scoot me somethin hot
In this salsa- merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees
In the carribean seas
With the hot mamis screaming "¡Ay papi!"
Everytime I come to town, they be spottin me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin me
So, cash in your dough
And flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
An' if you ask how I know, I gots ta plead the fifth
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami
Welcome to Miami
Don't get me wrong, Chi-town got it goin on
And New York is the city that we know don't sleep
And we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy
But on the sneak, Miami bringin heat for real
Y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnimon tans
Mira, this is the plan
Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimmie your hand
Damn, you look sexy
Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jetskis, loungin in the palm trees
Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on South Beach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom
Hundred-thousand dollar cars, e'ybody got em
Ain't no surprise in the club to see Sly Stallone
Miami, my second home
Miami
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami

Now Dad this is a very sensitive subject
Just the two of us
Just the two of us (just the two of us)
Just the two of us (just the two of us)
From the first time the doctor placed you in my arms
I knew I'd meet death before I'd let you meet harm
Although questions arose in my mind, would I be man enough
Against wrong, choose right and be standing up?
From the hospital that first night
Took a hour just ta get the car seat in right
People driving all fast, got me kinda upset
Got you home safe, placed you in your bassinet
That night I don't think one wink I slept
As I slipped out my bed, to your crib I crept
Touched your head gently, felt my heart melt
Cause I know I loved you more than life itself
Then to my knees, and I begged the Lord please
Let me be a good daddy, all he needs
Love, knowledge, discipline too
I pledge my life to you
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I
Five years old, bringin comedy
Everytime I look at you I think man, a little me
Just like me, wait an' see, gonna be tall
Makes me laugh cause you got your dads ears an all
Sometimes I wonder, what you gonna be
A general, a doctor, maybe a MC
Haha, I wanna kiss you all the time
But I will test that butt when you cut outta line, true that
Uh-uh-uh why you do that?
I try to be a tough dad, but you be makin me laugh
Crazy joy, when I see the eyes of my baby boy
I pledge to you, I will always do
Everything I can, show you how to be a man
Dignity, integrity, honor an'
I don't mind if you lose, long as you came with it
An you can cry, ain't no shame in it
It didn't work out with me an your mom
But yo, push come to shove, you was conceived in love
So if the world attacks, and you slide off track
Remember one fact, I got your back
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I
It's a full-time job to be a good dad
You got so much more stuff than I had
I gotta study just to keep with the changin times
101 Dalmations on your CD-ROM
See me-I'm tyin to pretend I know
On my PC where that CD go
But yo, ain't nothin promised, one day I'll be gone
Feel the strife, but trust life does go on
But just in case, it's my place to impart
One day some girl's gonna break your heart
And ooh ain't no pain like from the opposite sex
Gonna hurt bad, but don't take it out on the next, son
Throughout life people will make you mad
Disrespect you and treat you bad
Let God deal with the things they do
Cause hate in your heart will consume you too
Always tell the truth, say your prayers
Hold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears
You're living proof that dreams do come true
I love you and I'm here for you
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I
(This is a good song Dad, how much am I gettin paid for this?)

On the horizon bright light enters sight, tight
Cameras zoom on the impendin' doom
But then like *BOOM* black suits fill the room up
With the quickness talk with the witnesses
Hypnotizer, neuralyzer
Vivid memories turn to fantasies
Ain't no MiBs, can I please
Do what we say that's the way we kick it
Yaknahmean? I see my noisy cricket get wicked on ya
We're your first, last and only line of defense
Against the worst scum of the universe

If you ever get near us, don't jeer us, we're the fearless

Show love to the black suit, 'cause that's the Men in

And they be makin me crazy but I be takin it patiently
People be messin with me, testin me, f'n with me
I wanna send a message to 'em, teach 'em a lesson quickly
They publically addressin me, disrespectin me heavily
They better be lucky the way my blessings affected me, but
{*deep breath*} Calm down Willie
You don't wanna go drop the bomb now Willie

RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH

Larry Elder - Uncle Tom?
You're lucky I ain't make you the whole damn rhyme
Wendy Williams, you don't know me
I'm not your punchin bag, you gon' blow me
Up, girl, better leave me alone
Before I buy your radio station and send you home
Yo, it's a warnin shot over the bow
Truth be told, this ain't my style
You gotta understand some stuff a man can't allow
You better chill 'fore you climb a tree you can't get down
Okay - people dissing Will sat on a wall
People dissing Will had a great fall
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put none of their careers together again
You get it?
He's a nice guy - how ya doin?
He's a nice guy - good to see ya!
He's a nice guy - sometimes y'all

But oh wait, whoa y'all forgetting
When I was, amateur spitting before the scripts were written
First one in, last one out the club
Bursting in, passing out in the club
Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm
Taking you higher like a syringe hittin ya arm
Bringing the fire, making you Benz ring the alarm
Let me see you clap, spin baby come on

Whoo hoo what what what a what a say what what
Help out your mom and dad by gettin' a job

Ha ha
Uh, uh, it's twenty years of swag, y'all just witnessed
Let me remind everybody who Will Smith is
Rappers make it rain, let they money hit ya
If I throw my money up, shit, I'd probably kill a stripper
The illest, realest, Big Will-est
Down with the man in charge of where Uncle Phil is
Everybody wanna do Will Smith numbers
I don't know if your life got that many summers
I got inspired, quickly, I unretired, the Fresh Prince just re-wired
I'm slightly modified, but still
People dancing and shaking and moving and wiling
I feel like I'm an alien, really, kind of an island
I might fly to China for nothing, find a designer
Fix up a crib with me, my mom and Obama
Murder all over the globe, guilty, your honor
Rather become a Mormon, marrying Halle, Rihanna
I'm an anomaly, do drama or comedy
I could play Muhammud Ali or a white lady probably
Still, twenty years of swag y'all just witnessed
Stop the divorce rumors and mind your damn business
Rebirth of the click track, ridiculous
What I charge for a feature, man, that's expensive
Cause y'all be doing features, I be doing Features
So many tickets that theaters need bleachers
More information from me than from most teachers
More inspiration from me than from most preachers
But wait, wait, wait, wait, truly, just for the record
Directors make movies, I make directors
Y'all dinner table: "What y'all learn today?"
My dinner table: "What y'all earn today?"
The real life Incredibles, last name Smith
Jada, Jaden, Willow, Trey, shit, y'all ain't fucking with my clique
Its here and I like it
(Whoo! Ha-ha! Ha-ha!)
(Big Will, uh K-Ci y'all bringing it in)
(What?)
Its here and I like it
(Say what? What?)
(Say what? What?)
Gonna pack the dance floor
(And do what with it?)
Rock the dance floor
Here it comes the party of a lifetime
31st of December
Man I remember when the ball dropped for 90
Now it's 9-9, ten years behind me
What's gonna happen?
Don't nobody know
We'll see when the clock gets to 12-0-0
Chaos, the cops gonna block the street
Man who the hell cares?
Just don't stop the beat
No time to sleep, yo it's on tonight
K-Ci you feeling me right? (Yeah)
2-0-0-0, the Will 2 K
The new millennium, yo excuse me Willennium (yeah)
It can't get thicker than this (Big Will)
Slick like Rick I can't miss
(And we gonna party like it's 19)
Hold up it is
Here it comes another year
Come on everyone, new millennium
Here it comes another year
Everyone, new millennium
There's a party tonight
Everybody was drinking
The house was screaming
And the bass was shaking
And it won't be long
Till everybody knowing
That twelve o'clock the roof will be blowing
Drinks on me, up the cups, and
Midnight coming full thrust, and
Dick Clark holding it down, and
The second hand rolling around (Na, na, na, na)
Hundred thousands deep, world wide press
Hate to be the man that gotta clean this mess
Same resolution, get the money
Ain't where we've been, it's where we gonna be
Get ready to hum Auld Lang Syne
Cause a person that know the words is hard to find
First soul train line of the year
Four, three, two, one
Its here and I like it
(Whoo! K-Ci y'all, K-Ci y'all)
Gonna pack the dance floor
(And do what with it?)
Rock the dance floor
(Uh, uh, uh)
Here it comes another year
Come on everyone, new millennium
Here it comes another year
Everyone, new millennium
Say yeah, yeah
(Come on)
Say yeah, yeah
(I can't hear y'all)
Say yeah, yeah
(What? What? What?)
Say yeah, yeah
(Come on, come on)
Say yeah, yeah
(I can't hear y'all)
Say yeah, yeah
(I can't hear y'all)
Say yeah, yeah
(Ha-ha-ha)
Yeah, yeah
I remember trying to count how old I'd be
When the clock struck twelve in the year 2G
Medianoche finally near
This will be that anthem amongst the cheers
Just the man to usher it in
Big Will bringing the heat
K-Ci bringing the plan
Ringing it in, waiting for the ball to drop
That 2000 vault we breaking the lock
Let hip-hop keep blazing the charts
May the past keep a warm spot in your heart
May the future hold more joy then pain
Hands in the air waiting for confetti to rain
Its here and I like it
Gonna pack the dance floor
Rock the dance floor
Here it comes another year
Come on everyone, new millennium
Here it comes another year
Everyone, new millennium
There's a party tonight
Everybody was drinking
The house was screaming
And the bass was shaking
And it won't be long
Till everybody knowing at twelve o'clock
At 12 o'clock
Say what? Say what? Say what? What?
Here it comes another year
Come on everyone, new millennium
Here it comes another year
Everyone, new millennium
True dat, true dat, true dat

Yo Philly, come on, hey
Hey Tokyo, come on
Everybody say what now
Say what now, say what now
Come on, come on, come on
Big Willie!
Get on the floor!
Ohh! I'm the party starter
You might have a good time but we party harder
So, tell the DJ to play my song
And we can dance all night to the early morning
Dance, an afrodesiac
Women gyrating, simulating sensual acts
To stimulatin musical tracks
I thought I was just gon' come out at night and get a brew and relax
But no! Uh-uh, when you the party starter
It's like, you on call, you what the doctor ordered
It's like you gotta block the border to the door and
Shock 'em when it's boring, get on the floor!
Uhh, it's the groovicide bomber
Mic in my vest tight, strapped to my chest like
I'm a run up in the party holla and
Be like, oh! Fulfilling my calling
Big, Will, that's my name
Writing, rhymes, that's my game
Ask me again and I'll tell you the same
Look, just write your number right next to your name girl
Ohh! I'm the party starter
You might have a good time but we party harder
So, tell the DJ to play my song
And we can dance all night to the early morning
He was raised in the days when the roof was raised and
Every rap occasion, new and amazing
The back of the stage is amazed and gazing
Praying for the day they can one day praise him
Studied the ways of the game and made it
Came through the maze and the haze and played it
Perfect, dazed any person hated
And cursed 'em, he was unfazed, he waited
It was worth it, he never retaliated
He saved it, slaving, on the road blazing
Dazed when he was low, nothing could raise him
And came to the show and something uncaged in him
Like the pope of this party crusade
I'm like braids, that's never gon' fade, ya heard?
I'm like, 23's on an Escalade
Throw me into the rave like you threw a grenade, boom!
Ohh! I'm the party starter
You might have a good time but we party harder
So, tell the DJ to play my song
And we can dance all night to the early morning
I call for the days of the unadulterated
When the artistry was cultivated
You know back when rap was smart and multi-layered
We can rap without A&R's and ultimatums, damn!
Now today I say the praise, I long for the good old days
When the party was all about partying
I was a mini-party starter then
My mind bends when I call my pen
The big question, should I run to mine a vittle
Food for thought or, dumb the rhyme a little?
But Will if you come too high
That'll alienate folks, and they won't buy it
Yo, look, people getting trapped in the track
And they be clapping, even when the rappin is wack
And what happened? When did we get happy with that?
He old-fashioned? Yup! Well let's be happy he back, ya heard me?
Ohh! I'm the party starter
You might have a good time but we party harder
So, tell the DJ to play my song
And we can dance all night to the early morning
I-I-I-I woke up this morning
Looked at ya picture
Think about when I'm a get wit'cha
Hit ya on the two-way simply to say I gotta see you today
They say love is a gamble and if so, baby I'm the Belagio I can't lose
And I guess that make you the Mirage
Wait you more exotic than that you like the Taj Mahal momma
You a treasure to me life with you is a pleasure to me
And I'm a make sure no man ever measure to me
Like Run and D you and me are together forever
I got an interview to do (whoo)
Then to the plane, that too (whoo)
Uh wear that black dress boo (whoo)
Then close your eyes and open your heart and I'm a give you
All my love
A thousand kisses from you is never to much
All my love
Never too much never too much never too much
Uh huh uh huh
And I just don't wanna stop
Never too much mever too much
Woke up this morning to invite and couldn't wait to write you
I licked your back and then kissed three little kids that look just like you
Love is magic, can’t explain and sometimes it just happens
Saw your picture your so silly boy you keep my laughing
We've got a photo shoot can't concentrate my mind is roamin'
Because it's 4 o'clock and at 5:15 you are comin' home and
You know my heart you know my thoughts so ruffneck yet you're tender
The only person ever locked up safe was to surrender
All my love (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
A thousand kisses from you is never to much
All my love
Never too much never too much never too much
Uh huh uh huh
Cause I just don't wanna stop

Girl the way you look wanna make me say

Just so you all wanna make me say
(yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Yo, yo, mi amor, it's like a Picasso painted your aura
It's like Beethoven composed your vocal tones
Rodin inspired hand sculpted you the desire of man (uh)
Michelangelo grieves inside you
Seeds of my wildest dreams fertilized in your eyes
Your compationate and your passion is how you ration it
That makes me swear you was trained how to take me there
Rarely I seen faith be fared
We got a stroke of grace
Remember you was countin me out?
It's crazy we had times of doubt right?
And since the dawn of time written history
Better men better poet than me
Have tried to set verse to the love they knew
Dead to words judge what I do when I give you
A thousand kisses from you is never to much
All my love
Never too much never too much never too much
Uh huh uh huh
And I just don't wanna stop
Never too much mever too much

September 11th I woke up about 7 AM
West coast time, french toast and my turkey bacon
Takin my time awakin, turnin my TV on
To my surprise, saw what everybody in the world saw
Me and my children, images were chillin
My son said - daddy were there people in that building?
A cold sweat, frozen with a lump in my chest
I heard his question, couldn't bring my lips to say yes to him
That night at my son's side, he cried
And prayed for the ones who died in the World Trade
His palms to God, seeds of qualms with God
He just, kept on pressin me, wanna know why
Then one week later our bombs were dropped
We seein them, on CNN, they just won't stop
The infrared, images of brutal attack
He said "Daddy now we killin 'em back," right right
I really wish I could explain it baby
It's just the world is kinda crazy baby
Ain't no pretty way to paint it baby
Don't cry, dry your eyes
I really wish I could explain it baby
It's just the world is kinda crazy baby
Ain't no pretty way to paint it baby
Don't cry, dry your eyes
Souls are captured (souls are captured)
Dreams are stolen (dreams are stolen)
Hearts are broken (hearts are broken)
Evil plaguin he rewardin
Hate surrender (hate surrender)
Love exaulted! (Love exaulted!)
HOPE ELATED! (HOPE ELATED!)
Negativity DESTROYED AND..
Honest to God, why is the bomb always gettin the last word
And why, did her uncles have to molest her
And why, did all them cops have to be shootin to kill?
And why, did all them priests have to act so ill?
Tell me why did James Byrd Jr. have to be touched?
Tell my why did Malcolm and Martin depart from us
Tell me why did the sniper make that little boy shoot
And why, is human life always denied for loot?
Tell me why did Mandela have to live in a cage?
Why did my brother Sterling have to die at that age?
Tell me why did Reginald Denny deserve his fate?
And why the fuck can't love seem to defeat hate?
Tell me why is it so hard for all the children to eat?
Why did 'Pac and Biggie Smalls have to fall in the street?
Tell me why did Jam Master Jay have to go that way?
Please, what am I supposed to say my kids when they say
I really wish I could explain it baby
It's just the world is kinda crazy baby
Ain't no pretty way to paint it baby
Don't cry, dry your eyes
I really wish I could explain it baby
It's just the world is kinda crazy baby
Ain't no pretty way to paint it baby
Don't cry, dry your eyes
Can't explain it baby life is just really crazy
I mean if it's world wars or the life of a little baby
We got more stores than they got rice under buddha lazy
You live four scores and still it be drivin you crazy
But for me I try to see the bright side
Sometimes it be like the goodness be tryin to hide
Or tryin to flee, but it can't, it's deep inside
Sweetie you be the light for others, make 'em believe in God
This one goes out to all the big willies
Big Will the high roller
Strolling through with an entourage
Hard to camouflage when you living this large
I be smooth like Debarge with a five car garage
Out for the night with my squad
And we be flossing down the fifteen
My whole aura gleaming
Who that kid in the green V?
Envy brother scheming
I ain't thinking bout them
Racing chicks in the pink b.m
With my speakers tweakin'
Freaking off this weekend
In Las Vegas, boss players all across the board
Move makers and shakers
Money can't break us but the places it can take us
Big will in the limelight, rhyme tight
And we gon' have some fun tonight
Now how we do it?
(You know it's Big Willie style baby)
How we doing it?
(You know it's Big Willie style)
Now how we do it?
(You know it's Big Willie style baby)
How we doing it?
(You know it's Big Willie style)
I'm in a five star casino shutting crap tables down (boom)
Non betting willie watchers standing around
Strictly millionaire status you can feel the eyes looking at us
How bad they wanna be us (parlay)
Charlie Mack got my back with his eyes on my stack
Brothers don't know how to act when you drive a four-five black
People stop and stare having drinks at the bar
A round for everybody with these big willie cards
From civilians to stars they wanna know who we are
It's me big Will, Nas, Escobar, J.L. Omar
Carry money bags collect the chips then we all quick to swift exit
Now how we do it?
(You know it's Big Willie style baby)
How we doing it?
(You know it's Big Willie style)
Now how we do it?
(You know it's Big Willie style baby)
How we doing it?
(You know it's Big Willie style)
It's Left Eye with a tight crew
Representing like it's ladies night
Coming right through
Don't be spiteful
Plus an eyeful, Sporting hot pink
Rocks in the link, In the drop with a mink
Like my- don't stink
Got you in the palm with a bomb like Saddam
Blowing up spots then running off with the pot
Left Eye ready for action
The main attraction
I'm in the fast lane passing
Breaking you down like fractions
While we be rapping about things that really happen
Big willie style Philly style let's make it platinum
With Mademoiselle from Gezals to Versace
With a sweet smell
This female leading the posse
Got jokes like Cosby
In the lots where the cars be
With no apologies it's Left Eye
Big Will, let the champagne spill
Is it a man's thing for real?
Can us girls roll wit y'all
What the deal?
Now how we do it?
(You know it's Big Willie style baby)
How we doing it?
(You know it's Big Willie style)
Now how we do it?
(You know it's Big Willie style baby)
How we doing it?
(You know it's Big Willie style)
Well now it's looking like a car show
Convoys and whips on the strip
Pulling up in the six making brothers sick
For real
Big Will household name, Entertainer
Gold handle cane and matching gators
Swerving lane
In pole position rolling deep like a coalition
In soul position and can rock a whole convention
Movie screens to the club scene
My whole crew looking clean
Shine with a diamond gleam
Step above where the players be
Don't hate me
One is where they rate me
Lately you could find me
Behind the door marked V.I.P
Eating grapes under the A.C
Big willie style is how we do it
Now how we do it?
(You know it's Big Willie style baby)
How we doing it?
(You know it's Big Willie style)
Now how we do it?
(You know it's Big Willie style baby)
How we doing it?
(You know it's Big Willie style)
This one goes out to all the big willies
(let's listen to this dramatic show
Which was popular in the early days of radio)
Ha ha, unh, yeah yeah
Jazzy Jeff, Fresh Prince and uh
Jazzy Jeff, Fresh Prince and uh
Little taste of the old school
Jazzy Jeff, yo, break it down one time
Say what?
Unh, unh, unh, unh
One for the treble, two for the bass
Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince back up in your face
Me and Jeff again, "Oh my" you say
1985 to the Y2K
The new millenium, propehicies, I'm fulfillin' 'em
Everywhere I go, people be yelling "yo, that's Will and them"
(so fresh)
I check the rhyme like Quest
Some jokes dropped them doo-doo rhymes at my rest
The B-I-G, W-I-L-L
King of swing, and I rock well
The nail in the coffin of your average rapper
Jeff do the ditto for your average scratcher
Stature of a rapper slash actor
Back to the future on wax
The future of rap
Tap like Gregory Hines, read the headlines
Hip-hop's number one son still shines
Cause I'm (so fresh)
Big Will is (so fresh)
Jazzy Jeff is (so fresh)
West Philly is (so fresh)
Ladies and Gentlemen
Biiiiiz... Marrrr... KIE!
Yes y'all and to the funky beat and
Everytime you hear me rhyme, y'all be freakin'
The B-I-Z will wreck it, R-O-C-K it
You're guaranteed to like me, for what I am sayin'
To all those other emcees that be tryin' to get the info
Forget the rest cause I'm the best, and I'm a nympho-
Maniac, insaniac, I'll put you in a trance and
If you party with me, I'll always keep you dancin'
Always keep it hyper, no matter what type of
Jam, you know I'm fresh in flavor
Yeah, that's right, I'm talkin' 'bout me
The R-K-I-E in the place to be
I recognize and hypnotize, everytime I tenderize
I specialize and open eyes, to make you realize
That you've been rocked with Jeff's plain skills
The diobolocal, and my man Will
And we're (so fresh)
Ha, Big Will is (so fresh)
Biz Mark is (so fresh)
Jazzy Jeff is (so fresh)
Biz, do it
Whoo, for the old school
Unh, unh, ha ha
Ladies and gentlemen
Rrricky... D!
Well once upon a time eccentric head shorty
Where people wore pyjamas and went to bed early
There was a little boy, tight clout that might sprout
Tried to help lead black folk the right route
Delayed
Negative voices, many, once in prison for unwise choices that he once
Made*
Divide the men, cops were sent inside of him
And seeing the good he had within him, let him out again
The life no longer for a big time baller, vic
Big Willies like Will Smith now call the kid (yo Rick)
So check the gift, everything consecutive
That's what happens when you steer black folk away from
Negative*
Not to mention chasin' charts, killin' 'em
There'll be a member of the Biz-Mark, Will, and Rick
Demise sent, can't mess with the mindset
Come run with us, December 1999 said
It's all because of you, I'm feelin' sad and blue
You went away, now my life is just rainy days
I love you so, how much, you'll never know
You took your love away from me
Oh oh oh oh
You took your love away from me
Oh oh oh oh
You took your love, you took your love, you took your love
You took your love away from me
Slick Rick
Will Smith
Biz Mark
True dat, true dat
Jazzy Jeff y'all
Light up the place
I see you there now
Smoking from your unseen fire
Walk in the place
Then the darkness erase
You need a beat to help you light it up
I made a beat to help you light it up
You need a beat to make you light it up
Light up the place
Get lit with it, what, you can't get with it?
This is my room, this is my tool
This is my rule
Get fly with it, all up in the sky with it
Can't see me climb, come meet me, ah
Get lit
Miami, we like to party
We smart and naughty and we get lit
My people, good before evil
Big Will the sequel 'bout to get lit
This track is my kinda wave
If you're on the same page, come and get lit
'Cause we ain't stopping till we, light up the place
We ain't party Megatrons
We transform and get lit
We ain't party Megatrons
We transform and get lit
We ain't party Megatrons
We transform and get lit
We ain't party Megatrons
We (light up the place)
Light up the place
I'm coming through with the fire that's letting you now
The light inside of me ether and it's gonna blow
All of my people are lit so don't get in our way
It's the kind of celebrity we need today
The force around me is strong, my light been burning long
I do this for, I do this for y'all
My alchemy is strong, make it right from wrong
Man, I do this for y'all
You need a beat to help you light it up
I made a beat to help you light it up
You need a beat to make you light it up
Light up the place
Get lit
Get lit
Get lit
Get lit
Light up the place
Original - a first form from which varities arise
An authentic work of art as opposed to an imitation, or reproduction
Why should I try to sound like y'all sound?
That's what's wrong with the rap game right now
Man it's like a circus with a bunch of clowns
With a bunch of cliques I'll probably rap circles around
I spit heat rock, and I ain't talkin rollin
Soon as the beat knock I'm crown controllin
When I hear y'all that's an awful sound
I don't ride beats, I take 'em off the ground
Land 'em somewhere, show 'em the town
Even on foreign ground let 'em know I'm around
I don't follow e'rybody when it's time to rap
At one time e'rybody thought the world was flat
Sounds like you? That was my intention
I paid dues, now dudes pay attention
I live for it, even though the flicks is hittin
Crib's sick, you can see the booth from the kitchen
Speak on it, cause I saw it happen
This is hip-hop, dawg I ain't just rappin
Y'all lookin at a real MC man
You couldn't check a mic from me
Why should I try to sound like y'all sound?
That's what's wrong with the rap game right now
Why should I try to flow, the way y'all flow
Or do a show like y'all show, nah that ain't where my head at now
Y'all in the hip-hop lost and found
That's what's wrong with the rap game right now
Man it's like a circus with a bunch of clowns
With a bunch of cliques I'll probably rap circles around
Let's talk about rhyme capability
Let's talk about hip-hop versatility
Let's talk about takin the game beyond
How the hell we gon' have a battle of wits? Trick you unarmed
Let's talk about love for the game
I mean real love, back before there was fame
I'm real with it, I ain't claimin to reign
But when y'all talk about rap, y'all gon' start sayin my name
F'real though, I ain't playin
Plenty of y'all love a brother, just scared to say it
Yo, first ever rap Grammy
Let's talk about the only reason yo' ass went to Miami - yup!
Truck with rims - check; throwback jersey - check
Champagne bottles - check; lots of models - DAMN!
That's the list for 90% of y'all videos and songs
Am I WRONG?!
Why should I try to sound like y'all sound?
That's what's wrong with the rap game right now
Why should I try to flow, the way y'all flow
Or do a show like y'all show, nah that ain't where my head at now
Y'all in the hip-hop lost and found
That's what's wrong with the rap game right now
Man it's like a circus with a bunch of clowns
With a bunch of cliques I'll probably rap circles around
Lost - when you a slave to the biz
With no care for the cost of what you sayin to kids
Found is when your lyrics are a test of time
And your mind hear that your spirit is blessed divine
Lost is when you rhyme 'til your throat gets sore
But you don't even believe what you say no more
Found is when you bleed heart into the mic
And the pain you sustain it could change a life
Lost is when you hide behind the freedom of speech
Well sure you're free to do it, but what it mean to do it
Did you mean to do it? Did you need to do it?
Did you take time to think about the seed you ruined? (HUH?)
Found is Esco, Dead Prez and them
Found is Lauryn Hill
Found is Rakim
Found can be you if you felt the message
And ask yourself this question
Why should I try to sound like y'all sound?
That's what's wrong with the rap game right now
Why should I try to flow, the way y'all flow
Or do a show like y'all show, nah that ain't where my head at now
Y'all in the hip-hop lost and found
That's what's wrong with the rap game right now
Man it's like a circus with a bunch of clowns
With a bunch of cliques I'll probably rap circles around
Why should I try to sound like y'all sound?
That's what's wrong with the rap game right now
Why should I try to flow, the way y'all flow
Or do a show like y'all show, nah that ain't where my head at now
Y'all in the hip-hop lost and found
That's what's wrong with the rap game right now
Man it's like a circus with a bunch of clowns
With a bunch of cliques I'll probably rap circles around
Intro, the maestro, nice flow
Hot like nitro.. cool as ice though
That type of dichotomy, y'all know it's gotta be
Who else could it be BUT me?
Rub your eyes, behold the Big Williest
Dream supreme beam straight from Philly it's the
Eclectic female attractor
Rapper slash actor, right back at ya
And to the next millenium many come but few are chosen
See me servin like the U.S. Open
Another type of hustler listed at Blockbuster
.. go and ask a movie usher
Who is he? He or she - SFP
Movies, CD's, and TV's, but uh-uh
Cause today I take a break from that
As I roll where a tank of gas'll take me at
I used to rock these red Iroc Z's
Now I rock the MB's with the twelves and V's
Today, sun high.. up in the sky
From N.Y. la la to M.I., just cruisin
Where, baby, I don't care (just cruisin)
As long as you take me there (just cruisin)
Somewhere to clear my mind (just cruisin)
Just cruisin
Zero to sixty, flossin - 90 degrees
Sony cartridges, ten CD's each
Reach to the beach, Southside leanin
It ain't often I'm off and I'm feenin for the -
- top down, drop down got me hot now
Heated up can't stop now
What up cutie wop? Sure sure is cookin yo
I know I'm spoken for, can't hurt lookin though
Pop CD's, B-I-G's, then 2Pac's
While cruisin the blocks, hittin the hot spots
Got my celly on O-F-F
Golden Arches got my belly goin oh yes yes
So let's just - ease on down ease on down the road
No pager roll my hip as I'm rollin my whip
Cause today I'm on the solo creep
Man, why you think I be workin so hard all week?
I'm just cruisin
Where, baby, I don't care (just cruisin)
As long as you take me there (just cruisin)
Somewhere to clear my mind (just cruisin)
Just cruisin (I'm just cruisin)
Where, baby, I don't care (just cruisin)
As long as you take me there (just cruisin)
Somewhere to clear my mind (just cruisin)
Just cruisin
Sun settin in the S-K-Y
Must say I've had the best day I'm..
Tryin to find a exit, a place to chill
Not too hectic, so I can spend some time with Will
Let the, sunshine to the moonlight clear my mind
Soul search, see what I find
If I'm bein the best lover and friend
Am I being the best daddy I can?
I pray I am, and I feel good today
Reminisce as I'm cruisin around the way
Roll tight past the park where I used to play
Can't think of a better way to spend my day
Uh, still findin my way, still growin
Petrol blowin, moon soon showin
Gots to get goin, losin the light
And "The Freaks Come Out at Night," right
Just cruisin
Where, baby, I don't care (just cruisin)
As long as you take me there (just cruisin)
Somewhere to clear my mind (just cruisin)
Just cruisin (I'm just cruisin)
Where, baby, I don't care (just cruisin)
As long as you take me there (just cruisin)
Somewhere to clear my mind (just cruisin)
Just cruisin
Mic check, one two one two
This dedicated to an old friend of mine, Michelle
She a holy roller now, turned over a new leaf
Now e'rything old gon' burn (please help me not do it again)
Ms. Holy Roller, new angel
Wit'cha bible out shoutin and you ringin a bell
Mid-life, REBORN! And can't wait to tell
If I don't believe what you believe I'm goin to hell
Yo, I've been down with Jesus since Sunday school and Easter speeches
The, bible was survival that's what my grandma would teach us
Since I was 5 I've been dyin and tryin to read it
And when I did, it redefined it
Now you was 34 when you found Jesus after your life fell to pieces
Wife two times with two guys, now enlightening speeches
Seem to flow out your mouth with the hype of a preacher
Took your whole life to reach ya, now I'm a triflin creature?
Ms. Holy Roller, new angel
Wit'cha bible out shoutin and you ringin a bell
Mid-life, REBORN! And can't wait to tell
If I don't believe what you believe I'm goin to hell
C'mon, if I die right this second, I reckon that God
Would simply check into my life and times, dissectin my rhymes
He'll see how I've been leadin his troops
You can't do dirt your whole life and say - OOPS!
Now where was Jesus when you was cheatin and you was deceivin me?
Where was Jesus when you was greedy, your lawyers was bleedin me?
Where was Jesus when every weekend, a new man was livin wit'chu
Oh wait, he was with me, tryin to keep me from killin you!
Now where was Jesus when you was lyin and you was betrayin me?
When I was tryin to make it and you was hatin delayin me huh?
Where was Jesus when the ICE was thrillin ya?
Oh wait, he was with me, tryin to keep me from killin ya!
If I ain't know Jesus, ain't no tellin where I would be
It's been nights I felt like faeces, I needed to fight to release it
I'm in the limelight, it's hot and the heat is ceaseless and
Holdin my tongue while lil' bums cut me to pieces
The only reason's cause I studied the life of Jesus and
Ventin with my pen and intendin to write and release it
But when an ex-friend slight me and slam me with venom
I hate it, I can't stand, damn it I really resent it
I always strive to be righteous, my version of God
The reason why I never write rap verses with curses inside
The reason I never purposely hurt persons I've applied
Many teachings of God, searchin the reaches of God
Pondered the mysteries of why you be dissin me
I adore you, all I hope for you is freedom from misery
You made mistakes and blunders, you breakin from under but yo
If I'm goin to hell, it's makin me wonder
The greatest atrocities ever committed on this planet have been in the name of God
This country was founded by the Puritans for the express purpose of oppression free worship
Your attitude is the same arrogant fearful fundamentalism
That fueled the hatred, of the Crusades and the attacks of 9/11
If we are not allowed to worship God as groups and individuals free from persecution
And respect for tolerance, there's only one outcome
Ms. Holy Roller, new angel
Wit'cha bible out shoutin and you ringin a bell
Mid-life, REBORN! And can't wait to tell
If I don't believe what you believe I'm goin to hell, yo
Ms. Holy Roller, new angel
Wit'cha bible out shoutin and you ringin a bell
Mid-life, REBORN! And can't wait to tell
If I don't believe what you believe I'm goin to hell
Well, Yeah
Forever, forever, forever chasing forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever chasing forever
Early mornin' wake up
Gently with the caress on your hand
And that kimono that I bought you on my trip to Japan
Sunshine peekin through the venetian blinds
Four years, and like wine, you got finer with time
I got a question, if the Prada dressin and the Gucci
All got goes, and the freeze on the Lucci
I mean real bad girl, I'm talking rougher than rough
Do you think it'd be enough if we just had us?
Don't answer quick, think about it cause I'm askin for real
Golddiggers goin' to hear this song drivin and crash at the wheel
Forever is a long time, so far we gettin along fine
No car I ever drove, no ice I ever saw
No music I ever made, ain't nothin I wanted more
We could deal with whatever together
Sunshine, all that other weather, when we chasin forever
I wanna stay with you forever
(Forever, Forever, forever)
I wanna spend all my life with only you
(Forever chasing forever)
I wanna stay, lets stay together
(Lets stay together, forever, forever)
Chasing forever, with only you
(Forever chasing forever)
Chasin forever, a buckwild, endeavorous scene
Should we pursue with somethin real or just chasin a dream
Or casin' the scene
Fore I die I plan
To see your soul and eternity in the palm of my hands
Now as a man, there's certain things I'm lackin for sure
But I'm committed to growin and coming at you mature
In the future, I know it ain't gonna be all good
But when we feelin the hurt, if we willin to work
The eight ball will never turn to see us behind
Though I ain't no knight, and my armor don't shine
My mom said the lynch pin of love is trust
An taught me monogamy is a, monoga-must
Plus, for you dinner by candlelight
Now don't commit before you sure you understand me right
It's a race to a strange place, most see never
It's a chase we gotta make together, forever
I wanna stay with you forever
(Forever, Forever, forever)
I wanna spend all my life with only you
(Forever chasing forever)
I wanna stay, lets stay together
(Lets stay together, forever, forever)
Chasing forever, with only you
(Forever chasing forever)
Now you would think after all my heartbreaks I'd be cruel
Hiding behind my ego, evil but no
Much the contrary, I'm very much certain
You searching for joy, it's on the other side of hurtin
Finally found a person, worthy of all
Instead of pushing me down, you wanna cushion my fall
Your eyes could make the sun rise, all the birds sing
Seal it with a kiss, bind it with a ring
More carats than even bugs could eat in a week
And the ribbon in the sky, close your eyes don't peek
I'll tell you what I see in the future
A hacienda so cute with, five little kids calling you mom and calling me dad
Having more good times than JJ had
Judging by the look in your eyes, you see it
Let no man sever, welcome to forever
I wanna stay with you forever
(Forever, Forever, forever)
I wanna spend all my life with only you
(Each and every day forever chasing forever)
I wanna stay, lets stay together
(Forever, forever together)
Chasing forever, with only you
(Forever chasing forever)
I wanna stay with you forever
(Forever, Forever, forever)
I wanna spend all my life with only you
(Forever chasing forever, only you)
I wanna stay, lets stay together
(Forever, forever together don't you go no where)
Chasing forever, with only you
(Forever chasing forever)
Stay forever
(Forever, forever)
Each and every day
(Forever chasing forever)
Forever, Forever, forever
With only you
(Forever chasing forever)
Yo, if you can't dance, it's cool to get up now
Yeah see usually y'all stand off on the side
Y'know you're a lil' embarrased or whatever
But this one of them joints for e'rybody
So get up on up, but keep it simple, slide
If you can't dance then this is your jam, baby
Left to right, all night, slide, that's all you gotta do
If you can't dance then this is your jam, baby
Left to right, all night, slide, that's all you gotta do
Now we all know the boy at the club, all liquored up
Or with the bub tryin' to pick 'em up
Whack dancin', wookin pa nub
His shirt too bright, pants too tight, boy settle down
Now I ain't just messin wit'chu
I got better things to do, I'm tryin' to help
I got a lesson for you, I know you do the best you could do
Wanna get next to boo? Then the less you do, the better
Cause women equate dance with sex
They gon' see you, and be like, next
But you gon' be like, hold up ma!, next
But she gon' be like, uh-uh pah!, next
Now looka here, rule number one, know your name
It ain't Usher, Justin, Hammer? Then we can touch ya
Rule number two, never do a dance you can't do
Why stupid? You can't do it
If you can't dance then this is your jam, baby
Left to right, all night, slide, that's all you gotta do
If you can't dance then this is your jam, baby
Left to right, all night, slide, that's all you gotta do
So I'm up in my spot in Miami the other night right
And this dude out on the floor OD'n, just way overdancin
You know so his mami wanna holla at me
She thought my name was Billy, I told her it was Willie
She said she watched my TV show and I was very silly
Told her I was from Philly, she looked at me said really?
And judgin from her t-shirt I could tell that she was chilly
So I gave her my sweater, she said her name was Etta
She said she come from Cuba and she just had bought a Jetta
She said she glad I met her, let's go somewhere together
She said she'd ride in my car, cause she knew my car was better
The conversation cookin, attention gettin' tooken
My Spidey Sense is tinglin', I felt somebody lookin'
Now who this brother lookin, and now he runnin bookin'
I'm mad I'm like the fisherman I almost had my hook in
I figured I should get up, and quickly clear my head up
Rosetta got a man, got me feelin kinda set up
Now dude was really fed up, and yo he wouldn't let up
Homey if I hit you you might never ever get up
Now he was not a dancer, plus he wasn't handsome
Comin like Mel Gibson like I had his girl from ransom
Pedro wanna go outside, Yo amigo, tranquilo, slide
If you can't dance then this is your jam, baby
Left to right, all night, slide, that's all you gotta do
If you can't dance then this is your jam, baby
Left to right, all night, slide, that's all you gotta do
Now rule number three is easy
Please remember that you ain't on Beach Street
The sweet beat you ain't tryin to win no TV
Another dude get a move no need to outdo it
Rule number four, out on the floor
Don't be doin moves that don't nobody do no more
Draw too much attention it be adventurous on the floor
There's a reason that don't nobody do 'em no more, you feel me?
This may be hilarious
But rule number five is serious, uh
It's a shame to even have to discuss
But it's no lip biting or pelvic thrusts, I mean
You think that move'll put the sting on her?
You too close, tryin' to put a ring on her?
You don't know that girl, don't cling on her
And don't put your thing on her, cool?
If you can't dance then this is your jam, baby
Left to right, all night, slide, that's all you gotta do
If you can't dance then this is your jam, baby
Left to right, all night, slide, that's all you gotta do
Big Will, raisin' the roof, raisin' the roof
(Show 'em how to do it, Will)
Observe the high roller, mic controller
Number one hip-hop son, call me solar
Why? 'Cause I shine, praise the Big Willie, I'm
Raised in Philly, I, daze and thrillin' ya
Don't be silly, ya, can't see me
Again I'm killin' ya on MTV
Just get with it my friend (Damn another award?)
Dat kid done did it again (Oh my Lord!)
Da fantastic, boombastic
Gettin' ten times hotter than any you other cats get
Practice, you lack this, I'm the real McCoy
First with Jeff I was startin'
Then with Martin I'm a Badboy
See more green than David Banner
More juice than Tropicana
You hawkin' me like Atlanta
MCs just flee, they rightfully concerned
Big Will wants the mic back, it's my turn to burn
Baby, uh, baby, uh
Verse two, verse two
I'm back attackin' the mic, hype like a Viking
Strikin' like a python, blaze like Jon
A hip-hop icon, MC radical
Back on track from my rap/act sabbatical
Nine-point-six on the richter, kicked her
Yeah so slick the, chicks quick to, flip tha
Bright glance and the tight pants for the slight chance
"Big Willie can we get one dance?"
Why yes, you may an', I'm just sayin'
That dress you playin', is A-Okay an'
This is your chance for, at least it could be
Me, you an your girlfriend on the dancefloor, ménage-boogie
On the scene I fronts and dashin', fashion
Lost my cream once, now I'm stashin', cashin'
Countries and currencies, like a true Don
It's a new time and it's mine, watch me shine
The way I blaze through the days and nights
How I deal with the craze, my momma raised me right
Whether I'm on stage or in the studio booth
A hundred proof, raisin' the roof, raisin' the roof
(Y'all know) Can't nobody rock a crowd like me
(She know) Can't nobody make it bounce like me
(He know) Can't nobody get it hot like me
(You know) Y'all need to stop 'cause you can't see me
(Y'all know) Can't nobody rock a crowd like me
(He know) Can't nobody make it bounce like me
(She know) Can't nobody get it hot like me
(Y'all know) Y'all need to stop 'cause you can't see me
Seven continents I bruise all cruise
Adidas, kilts, or bamboos and no shoes
Eskimos to Aborigines
I'll test the flows of the world's MCs
I'll hit you out the ball park, you just all talk
Don't be lookin' at my script, you can't play my part
See I'm a rapper that's a actor, you act rap with no heart
The way that I compose those flows like Mozart
Gets somthing like a symphony, when I'm orchestratin' 'em
Ever since the days of me and Jeff at the Paladium
All my life I've been the cream of the crop
Shoppin' a dream, now I got a crop full of cream
I raise mics for the flow of it, you know the show of it
Not the Benz 600 four door of it
I'm a rhyme regardless of earnin'
Long as my heart keeps yearnin' I gots to keep burnin'
(Y'all know) Can't nobody rock a crowd like me
(She know) Can't nobody make it bounce like me
(He know) Can't nobody get it hot like me
(You know) Y'all need to stop 'cause you can't see me
(Y'all know) Can't nobody rock a crowd like me
(He know) Can't nobody make it bounce like me
(She know) Can't nobody get it hot like me
(Y'all know) Y'all need to stop 'cause you can't see me
(Y'all know) Can't nobody rock a crowd like me
(She know) Can't nobody make it bounce like me
(He know) Can't nobody get it hot like me
(You know) Y'all need to stop 'cause you can't see me
(Y'all know) Can't nobody rock a crowd like me
(He know) Can't nobody make it bounce like me
(She know) Can't nobody get it hot like me
(Y'all know) Y'all need to stop 'cause you can't see me
(Y'all know) Can't nobody rock a crowd like me
(She know) Can't nobody make it bounce like me
(He know) Can't nobody get it hot like me
(You know) Y'all need to stop 'cause you can't see me

Yo, ain't no better man for this hype track
Just the veteran taking the mic back
David Letterman even said he like that track man
Even though he ain't a rap fan
Black radio, they won't play though
Ever since "Summertime," they ain't liked none of mine
Even though the fans went out and bought enough
I guess they think Will ain't hard enough
Maybe I should just have a shootout
Run up in the bank, bustin', grabbin' all the loot out
Whoop somebody ass, taking my boot out
Right on TV so y'all can see me
Just ignorant, attacking, actin' rough
I mean, then, will I be Black enough?
Oh wait, maybe I'll jack a truck
Full of cigarettes, guns and drugs and stuff
Get back, I wish I woulda made that
Lean back, I wish I woulda made that
I wish I woulda told the girls to "drop it like it's hot"
Summer, summer, summertime, seems like all I got
Get back, I wish I woulda made that
Lean back, I wish I woulda made that
I wish I woulda told the girls to "drop it like it's hot"
Summer, summer, summertime, seems like all I got
I always envied how y'all rocked with Dre and The Chronic
The way that 2Pac, Biggie, 50 and Jigga got it
A lot like L.L., Chuck D, Slick and Dougie
I think y'all love me, but y'all place other rappers above me
And I don't know if you feel my flow
And be at my show and you'll see where I should go
On the charts of rhyme, arts and thoughts in rap form
Damn it, I expanded the platform
Damn it, this cat's on a rap song
Yeah, it ain't no braids or plaits on
Ain't on stage with no gats on
You know I'm afraid, getting' my act on
It might have stunted my growth but I wanted them both
And I hope that it would be less tougher
You do two things and then they both gonna suffer
I chose to act and it broke my heart not to rap
Prodigal son, clever, better than ever, back
Get back, I wish I woulda made that
Lean back, I wish I woulda made that
I wish I woulda told the girls to "drop it like it's hot"
Summer, summer, summertime, seems like all I got
Get back, I wish I woulda made that
Lean back, I wish I woulda made that
I wish I woulda told the girls to "drop it like it's hot"
Summer, summer, summertime, seems like all I got
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got, I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
Yo, do you see that lil' bop in my step
Do you see the little drop to the left, huh, yo
Baseball cap, Timbs when I walk
Do you see that lil' grin when I talk, huh, yo
Do you see me sorta glide when I slide
See lean to the side in my ride, huh, yo
Do you see it's no ice on my wrist
Fish still bite just like this. right, right
Do you know what it mean
When you see a dude's chick on TV gleamin', huh?
Know what it mean to be on the screen
And in the audience, Ali beamin', yo!
I must have a 'S' on my chest
I recovered from the Wild Wild West, yes!
Yo, I been up the creek without a paddle
Now I'm back on the saddle
I got my swagga back
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got my swagga back
All you see that you see when you seeing me
You ain't seeing all to be seen
Cause there's more for you to see
Than when you see me on the scene in my media machine
I mean madness, sickness, sadness, swaggerless back in the day
Fat, ugly chicks in New York on the radio, saying I'm gay
I had a bonafide downside frown
With the swagga not around in my life
Bank account found minimal amounts
When countin' cause of my now ex-wife
I had to bore thick walls and all that
Endure pitfalls and all that, fallin', callin' for help
With no call back, where was ya'll at, gimme the ball back
I got my swagga back
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got my swagga back
