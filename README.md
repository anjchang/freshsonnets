# freshsonnets
A mashup between Will Smiths Raps and Will Shakespeares Sonnets

Code is in the Python notebook.

The source files were cleaned by replacing using regex:
<pre>
In sonnetall2021.txt:
\u2019
\u2013
empty newlines

In willsmith.txt :
\d?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy 
Chorus\s\d\d?:\n
</pre>

Other than that, it was interesting learning to use the lyrics api, and also FODF to format a pdf.

I wish that I could have done something like replacing interesting words from one to the other-- maybe next year!
